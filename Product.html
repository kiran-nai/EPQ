                <h2>Stem Cell Differentiation</h2>
            <p>When stem cells differentiate, they follow three pathways(from innermost to outermost): the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm layers. The endoderm allows the cells to differentiate into the cells that line the body internally, such as the lungs, liver and pancreas. The mesoderm allows the cells to differentiate into the cells that make up the tissues in the body, such as the heart and muscles. Finally, the ectoderm allows the cells to differentiate into cells that line the body externally, such as the outermost skin layer and hair.</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Vascularisation is also important for any artifical organoids or organs which is where blood vessels are extended into them to allow them to grow and develop fully. In vitro methods involve bioprinting tissue with channels to allow blood to permeate in. In vivo methods are when the organ/organoid  is transplanted into the host, and the connections are formed between the host organ and organoid naturally and joined onto existing structures</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Scaffold-based manufacturing is when a scaffold is used as a housing for the cells to attach and grow on. There are two types of scaffolds: scaffolds that are decellularised organs from an animal roughly the same shape as a human or 3D printed scaffold. The animal organ, when received, is put in a solution bath for a set period, where all the animal's biomass is removed, and all that is left is the collagen scaffold for the cells to grow on. The 3D scaffold is printed and made of a custom blend of collagen derived from a tobacco plant that is turned into a bioink; the scaffold can be made at a subcellular resolution</p>

            <br>

            <p>For both these scaffolds to have cells cultured onto them, a bioreactor is needed. The bioreactor controls the precise conditions of the environment including temperature and oxygen concentrations. It also provides different stimulations for the stem cells to differentiate. Chemical stimulation is adding chemicals to help differentiation whereas mechanical is applying a force to cells to allow differentiation </p>
