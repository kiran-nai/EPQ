            <h2>Impact on Healthcare Systems</h2>
            <p>The hospital's infrastructure would have to change so that there are facilities that can meet the requirements needed for each step of the process of manufacturing the organ, from the initial cell reprogramming to the culturing. This change could include integrating cutting-edge technology for tissue engineering and hiring professionals who can use all the technology to manufacture an organ.</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Before healthcare systems can reliably use the stem cells for any form of organ manufacturing whether it's using a scaffold or organoids, first they must make sure the development of the stem cells is safe. If a patient receives an organ where some of the cells have incorrectly differentiated then this impairs the organs function and could have catastrophic issues. For this reason healthcare systems need to wait so that the scale of organ manufacturing is deemed as safe.
</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Stem-cell organ manufacturing can replace the dependency on donor organs because an organ can be manufactured to suit the individual's needs. This reduced dependency can help reduce many countries' organ shortages, as many organs can be manufactured. The high number of manufactured organs makes organ availability more equitable, and now, more people from different backgrounds have equal opportunities for an organ. Furthermore, the traditional factors governing who gets an organ have shifted now, so it is based more on a medical need than biological factors such as tissue matching due to the higher numbers of manufactured organs. </p>

            <br>

            <p>The conventional method of organ transplant is incredibly costly, with the average cost of a heart transplant in the US costing $1,664,800.In comparison stem cell therapy can be costly with it ranging anywhere between $5000 to $50,000 depending on the complexity of the treatment.Organ manufacturing would be on the higher side of this range and could cost healthcare systems a huge amount currently. There is no exact figure that can be used for the cost of implementing this however a high-end printer can cost up to £300,000 and assuming £50,000 for the development of the stem cells then for one manufactured organ it would cost around £350,000.Although stem cell therapy is in its infancy, there is still much progress to be made before it can be used for manufacturing organs</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Manufactured organs allow for a more personalised medical approach to treating patients. In contrast, previously, a patient would have to accept an organ that would most likely have been a different size from their previous one. However, with manufactured organs, patients can receive the correctly sized organ far sooner than possible. Havinga greater mismatch in the size of the organ being transplanted could result in a compromise in the function of the organ such as in the lungs where a study found that mismatching organ sizes can cause organ failure. This results in faster healing and, overall, a shorter recovery time. </p>
