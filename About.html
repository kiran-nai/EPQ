            <p>Organ compatibility is essential for transplants, with a close match between the recipient and donor required. The main factor involved is compatible blood types; however, other factors could be involved for different organs.For kidneys, for example, tissue matches and compatible antibody sizes are necessary. There will always be a slight rejection requiring patients to take immunosuppressants for the remainder of their life.<br><br> Organ compatibility is important because the more compatible the organ is to the host then the lower the effect of rejection.
</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Immunosuppression is where the immune system is weakened, which makes it harder for the body to fight off infections and is something that patients who undergo organ transplants have to suffer from. Patients who undergo transplants need to suppress their immune system because their immune system recognises the transplant as foreign and attacks those cells.</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Peri-transplant donor Tissue damage is also a significant factor, which is where after blood returns to tissue that has been lacking oxygen it triggers an inflammatory response and damage so the organ gets damaged</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>In countries where healthcare is not free, for example, the United States, individuals who are of a low socio-economic status (SES) are at a distinct disadvantage. SES is a measure of a person’s economic and sociological status; it can determine access to healthcare and contributes to choices between basic needs and healthcare due to the cost. A lower SES has been found to have high failure rates among patients after kidney transplantations. This higher failure rate is primarily due to non-adherence to the medication regime after the transplant; the cost of post-transplant medication can be pretty costly for some, leading to lower medication adherence</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>People on a waiting list are matched using a variety of factors but if two people match for the same donor organ who gets it? Here the medical prinicple of justice is used. Justice in medicine is being fair; in organ transplants, each patient must be treated fairly when making a choice. However, ultimately, only one person will receive the organ, and multiple factors must be considered before making a choice. One factor that is considered is the medical urgency of the patient’s condition, the likelihood of finding a suitable organ, and the distance between the potential recipient and donor.While the principle of justice ensures fairness throughout the process, the scarcity of the organs means difficult decisions must be made. It can result in one patient dying over another.</p>
