            <h2>Benefits of Stem Cells</h2>
            <p>Immunosuppressants are currently required for all patients who undergo transplants, and this weakens their immune system overall leaving them susceptible to other pathogens. However using stem cells to manufacture organs won't have this issue because the patients own cells are used and therefore the immune system won't recognise the cells as foreign. This could save the NHS up to £2.95 billion </p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>Stem cell therapy can also help reduce the shortage of donor organs; by manufacturing an organ, it can be placed immediately into a patient.It can also help with making sure an organ correctly suits and fits the patient; because it is being artificially manufactured then, it can be modified to suit the patient allowing for a more personalised medicine approach.
</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention states that "90% of the nation's $4.1 trillion expenditures in annual healthcare are for people with chronic and mental health conditions", with an estimated half of the American population suffer from at least one chronic condition [38]  and creates a burden on healthcare systems as resources need to be given to help to manage the condition as they often can’t be fully cured due to the low number of donors.Stem cells can be used to either repair the tissue or completely replace the organ, mitigating the need for a heart transplant. They can be applied to help with many chronic diseases, reducing the current dependencies on treatments such as medication and improving a patient's overall quality of life. </p>
<br>
            <br>
<h2>Drawbacks of Stem Cells</h2>
            <p>The stem cells used are pluripotent, which allows them to differentiate into various cell types; however, when they divide, they carry the risk of genetically mutating.The more divisions, the greater the chance of a mutation, and if the mutation changes the cell's DNA to turn off the tumour suppressor genes or to create oncogenes(genes that cause uncontrolled growth), then this results in cancer.This risk could be a considerable issue during organ manufacturing because, over time, the stem cells could develop into cancerous cells, affecting the organ's function, spreading to other body regions, and causing cancers elsewhere.</p>
<br>
            <br>
            <p>One major challenge in stem cells is getting a population of one type of stem cells. Pluripotent stem cells are used for this procedure, which does have benefits such as its fast ability to divide and multiply, which means that there are high numbers of stem cells for any given procedure. However, their pluripotency means cell differentiation is challenging to control as the stem cell has many different paths to differentiate down. </p>
