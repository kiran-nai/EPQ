    <h1>The purpose behind the EPQ</h1>
    <center>
         <p>I've always been fascinated by stem cells and their remarkable nature to have the ability to turn into any cell possible</p>
            <p>However it's only through researching this EPQ have I had any idea how powerful these cells are. These cells posses the ability to completely revolutise the healthcare industry by regenerating damaged tissues and organs.</p>
            <p> In recent years, the advancements in stem cell research has propelled us closer to the future where anyone can easily receive a manufactured organ.</p></center>
